This open source package implements a series of components required for comprehensive quality assurance on annotations created using GATE

This system was described in the following paper:

+ paper link.

## Setup/Installation

The `requirements.txt` file lists all required Python3 packages installable with pip3. Just run
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
to install all packages.

## Quality Assurance components

- Error Checks
  
- Validations
  
- Statistics

- Evaluation

- Discrepancy Analysis

- Corpus Viewer


## Demo script/data

This package includes `n` small datasets for code demonstration purposes:

- ```demo_data/demo_dataset_1``` dataset description
- ```demo_data/demo_dataset_2``` dataset description
- ```demo_data/demo_dataset_3``` dataset description
- ```demo_data/demo_dataset_n``` dataset description

The included `demo_script` script utilizes the provided datasets to make a complete complete end-to-end quality assurance process, with the following steps:

1. step 1
2. step 2
3. step 3
4. step 4
5. step n

To use the tool just run
```
python app.py <path_to_config_file>
